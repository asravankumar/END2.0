# What is a neural network neuron?
  A neuron is the most basic element part of a neural network. It is a mathematical function that receives set of input values and computes a weighted sum with set of weights. This weighted sum is then pass to a non-linear activation function to form the output. Multiple neurons organized in layers is a neural network.A neuron can be visualized as a temporary storage unit which computes based on the input values, weights and activation function and passes the output to the next layer.

# What is the use of the learning rate?
# How are weights initialized?
# What is "loss" in a neural network?
# What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?
